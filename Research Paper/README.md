This research paper is about the [DDPM](DDPM.pdf) - **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models**. Mathematics and Algorithm used in the model is well explained in this Research Paper.
Refer to this paper for fixing the bugs and resolving issues.  
*Page 3* and *Page 4* are more relevant to the algorithm used in the code.

Also refer to [U-Net Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/u-net-architecture-explained/) for better understanding of the NN model.
