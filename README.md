# Stable Diffusion
Welcome to the **Stable_Diffusion_Scratch** repository! This project contains a Diffusion Model built from scratch, designed to provide a hands-on learning experience in diffusion model fundamentals. The repository is structured to enable contributors to build, train, and experiment with custom diffusion model implementations, and enhance them with various functionalities.

## Introduction

This repository contains a **Text-to-Image generation model** based on **Diffusion Models**, a powerful generative technique that progressively transforms random noise into realistic images. Unlike other generative models like GANs, diffusion models operate through a process of denoising, which makes them particularly good at generating high-quality, coherent outputs.  

## Diffusion Model Breakdown
Diffusion models generate images through two key processes:
1. **Forward Diffusion**: Noise is gradually added to the input data until it becomes unrecognizable.
2. **Reverse Diffusion**: The model is trained to reverse this process, removing noise step-by-step to reconstruct the original image.

The model is trained to learn this reverse process, so it can generate new data from noise.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have an up-to-date version of Python.
- **PyTorch 1.7+**: This project is built on PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.
- **CUDA (Optional)**: GPU support is recommended for faster training times with CUDA.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wncc/Hello-FOSS-ML-Diffusivity.git
   cd Stable_Diffusion_Model/Stable_Diffusion_Scratch

2. **For the other dependencies, you can install them with:**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy torch torchvision matplotlib

## Project Structure
